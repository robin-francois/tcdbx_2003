Backup of the TCDBx, the Apple Type/Creator Database, originally by Ilan Szekely

This is a CSV conversion + utf-8 transcoding of the original XLSX database : http://www.lacikam.co.il/tcdb/download/TCDBdata.zip  

TCDB was originally a shareware but the data has since been freely shared, as stated on the website: https://www.lacikam.co.il/tcdb/  
```tcdb is obsolete since 2003 and the emerging of OS X. The Excel source file with all the data can be downloaded for free```

According to the Wikipedia "Creator code" page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_code):  
A creator code is a mechanism introduced in the classic Mac OS to link a data file to the application program which created it.
The similar type code held the file type, like "TEXT". Together, the type and creator indicated what application should be used to open a file, similar to (but richer than) the file extensions in other operating systems. 
Creator codes are four-byte OSTypes. They allow applications to launch and open a file whenever any of their associated files is double-clicked.
Creator codes could be any four-byte value, but were usually chosen so that their ASCII representation formed a word or acronym.
For example, the creator code of the HyperCard application and its associated "stacks" is represented in ASCII as WILD, from the application's original name of WildCard.
Occasionally they represented inside jokes. For instance, the Marathon computer game had a creator code of 26.2 (the approximate length, in miles, of a marathon) and Marathon 2: Durandal had a creator code of 52.4.
