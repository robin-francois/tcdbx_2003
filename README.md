# tcdbx_2003
Backup of the TCDBx, the Type/Creator Database, originally by Ilan Szekely

This is a CSV conversion + utf-8 transcoding of the original XLSX database : http://www.lacikam.co.il/tcdb/download/TCDBdata.zip  

TCDB was originally a shareware but the data has since been freely shared, as stated on the website: https://www.lacikam.co.il/tcdb/  
```tcdb is obsolete since 2003 and the emerging of OS X. The Excel source file with all the data can be downloaded for free```
